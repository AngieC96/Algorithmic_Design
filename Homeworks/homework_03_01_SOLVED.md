# Sorting: Homework



- *By using the code at:*

  â€‹                                         https://github.com/albertocasagrande/AD_sorting

  *implement Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort.*

- *For each of the implemented algorithm, draw a curve to represent the relation between the input size and the execution-time.*

- *Argue about the following statement and answer the questions*

  1. *Heap Sort on a array $A$ whose length is n takes time $O(n)$.*
  2. *Heap Sort on a array $A$ whose length is n takes time $\Omega(n)$.*
  3. *What is the worst case complexity for Heap Sort?*
  4. *Quick Sort on a array A whose length is n takes time $O(n^3)$.*
  5. *What is the complexity of Quick Sort?*
  6. *Bubble Sort on a array A whose length is n takes time $\Omega(n)$.*
  7. *What is the complexity of Bubble Sort?*

- *Solve the following recursive equation:*
  $$
  T(n) = \begin{cases}
  \Theta(1) & \text{if } n = 32 \\
  3 * T \left( \frac n 4 \right) + \Theta (n^{3/2}) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \nonumber
  $$
