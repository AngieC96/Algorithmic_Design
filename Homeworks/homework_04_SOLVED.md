# Weighted Graphs: Homework

- *Implement the array-based version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm.*
- *Implement the binary heap-based version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm by using the library `binheap` that was developed during [Lesson 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyHUQ1nn8WM), [Lesson 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWFAPkgZ_7Q), and [Lesson 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BnGCXzkFbo).*
- *Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and compare their execution times.*
