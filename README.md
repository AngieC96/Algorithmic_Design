# DSSC - Algorithmic Design
This repository contains the codes developed in the course "Algorithmic Design" of the master course in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the University of Trieste.



## Homeworks

The folder [Homeworks](Homeworks) contains all the homeworks solved.



## 01 Strassen's Algorithm

The folder [01_Strassen_alg](01_Strassen_alg) contains some code to simplify the implementation and the testing of the Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication.



## 02 Strassen's Algorithm Rectangular Matrices

The folder [02_Strassen_alg_rect](02_Strassen_alg_rect) contains some code to simplify the implementation and the testing of the Strassen's algorithm for rectangular matrix multiplication.



## 03 Binary Heaps

The folder [03_Binary_heaps](03_Binary_heaps) contains a simple array-implementation of binary heaps in the C-programming language.



## 04 Binary Heaps No Swap

The folder [04_Binary_heaps_noswap](04_Binary_heaps_noswap) contains a simple array-implementation of binary heaps in the C-programming language that doesn't swaps the elements of the array, so to be more efficient, but uses two arrays to keep track of the position of the nodes in the heap and in the array.



## 05 Sorting Algorithms

The folder [05_Sorting](05_Sorting) contains the implementation and testing of sorting algorithms. The algorithms implemented are: insertion sort, quick sort (with and without the select algorithm to identify the pivot), bubble sort, selection sort, and heap sort.



## 06 Dijkstra's Algorithm

The folder [06_Dijkstra](06_Dijkstra) contains the implementation and testing of Dijkstra's algorithm.
