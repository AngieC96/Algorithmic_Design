We include a standard {\ttfamily Makefile} for convenience, so you can run the usual {\ttfamily make} commands; out-\/of-\/source build are not supported.

It is also possible to generate the {\ttfamily Makefile} via {\ttfamily cmake} by opening a terminal in the source code folder and running \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" CMakeLists.txt
make
\end{DoxyVerb}


In both cases, if everything goes as it should, you now have an executable {\ttfamily strassen\+\_\+test.\+x} in your build folder {\ttfamily \$\+B\+LD}. You can run it via \begin{DoxyVerb}./strassen_test.x
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{index_sec_builddoc}{}\subsection{Build the documentation}\label{index_sec_builddoc}
You can build the documentation by running \begin{DoxyVerb}make doc
\end{DoxyVerb}


The documentation is built into the folder {\ttfamily \$\+B\+LD/doc/}, where {\ttfamily \$\+B\+LD} is your build folder.
